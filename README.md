===============
This weeks assignment involved manipulating the UI using only script. We did this by adding a score variable that was
displayed on the screen. We then created an action and a condition within Unrealscript. The Action allowed us to increase
the variable that was displayed while the condition allowed us to check that score against a win condition.
